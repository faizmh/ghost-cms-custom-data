What you\'re looking at is Ghost\'s first major UI refresh, with a strong focus on being more usable and robust all round.\n\n![New Design](https://ghost.org/images/zelda.png)\n\nThe main navigation menu, previously located at the top of your screen, has now moved over to the left. This makes it way easier to work with on mobile devices, and has the added benefit of providing ample space for upcoming features!\n\n## Lost and found: Your old posts\n\nFrom talking to many of you we understand that finding old posts in the admin area was a real pain; so we\'ve added a new magical search bar which lets you quickly find posts for editing, without having to scroll endlessly. Take it for a spin!\n\n![Search](https://ghost.org/images/search.gif)\n\nQuestions? Comments?
